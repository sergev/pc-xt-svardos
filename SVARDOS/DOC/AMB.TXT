AMB is a reader of eponymous AMB (Ancient Machine Book) files. AMB stands for
"Ancient Machine's Book". It is an extremely lightweight file format meant to
store any kind of hypertext documentation that may be comfortably viewed even
on the most ancient PCs: technical manuals, books, etc. Think of it as a retro
equivalent of a *.CHM help file.
AMB is a multiplatform tool, available for Linux, Windows and real mode DOS.
It is designed for minimum hardware requirements - the DOS version needs an
IBM PC-compatible machine with DOS 2+ and 64 KiB of available RAM.


=== USAGE ====================================================================

Start the AMB reader with the following syntax:

  AMB FILE.AMB [chaptername]

FILE.AMB is the AMB book that you wish to read, while the optional chaptername
argument allows to specify the name of the chapter you'd like AMB to start
from (otherwise it will use the default "index" page).

Once loaded, you may navigate through the book using a mouse or the keyboard:

 UP/DOWN      move the cursor up/down (scrolls the document when necessary)
 LEFT/RIGHT   move the cursor left/right on the current line
 PGUP/PGDOWN  move one page up or down
 TAB          jump to next link
 ESC          either move to previous page or (if no previous page) quit
 ENTER        follow the currently highlighted link

When using a mouse, you can scroll the document by clicking on the right
cursor bar and follow links by clicking twice on them.
